## Omniverse Info System

This is a website that combines question-answering, blogging and group-finding all in one platform. 
Our project is our suggested solution to solving a problem faced by students due to a lack of an integrated web-based information and communication system using a Laravel framework of PHP.

## Installing a project
- Install the latest version of XAMPP at the website [XAMPP Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- Configure the php.ini file to allow the extension mysql
- Install composer and npm from the websites, [download Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and [download npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Open the command line and type `composer global/require laravel`
- Create a folder on which the project will be hosted and open the terminal in that directory and type `composer new laravel:livewire omniverse_info_system`
- After a successful installation, type `run npm dev && run npm build` to build the scaffolding.
- Install Git Bash and after successful installation open Bash in the directory of the project.
- In Bash, type `git clone https://github.com/George-Stephen/omniverse_info_system.git` to import the project from the online repository to your local machine

  *These steps work on **all** platforms*
