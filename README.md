## About Our project

Communication and seeking information in school is often hard to do even with the internet involved. With emails, there are situations where the information that is sent is bundled with other information that is not relevant to a certain student and they may miss the relevant information that they need. Furthermore, students will have to be in a mailing list to have the message sent to them. This may be a challenge to some students who are travelling and would have to send an email requesting to be placed in a mailing list. Waiting for this feedback might take a long time and during that time important information may have been conveyed to those in the mailing list and those still waiting to be placed in the mailing list would be excluded. Moreover, using social media groups messages is limiting to those who are looking to reach multiple students since they would have to be included in such chat groups or would have to know someone from the chat group who could convey the message on their behalf. A student may also like to know if there could be another student who might be willing to buy or sell a certain item or service and this is hard to do given the limitations to reach the relevant audience as well as a lack of a platform to do so. To address these challenges, this web-based project provides a centralized platform where this information can be accessible exclusively to the school. It eliminates the vexation of dealing with irrelevant information and the need for a mailing list or need to create multiple chat groups, allows a platform for advertising, blogging and an online market in which students may use to better their student life at the university.

Our project is our suggested solution to solving a problem faced by students due to a lack of an integrated web-based information and communication system using a Laravel framework of PHP.
